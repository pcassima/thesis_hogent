# Our bachelor's thesis at HoGent
The complete documentation can be found at: [full documentation](https://www.pcassima.github.io/thesis_hogent "Thesis documentation").

Our project was presented at the Mini MakerFaire 2019 in Gent.

## What is it?
It is our thesis to achieve a Bachelor's degree in **Industrial automation**.
Together with our teacher we wanted to improve the practical side of our education. As well as link the different
subjects better to the work-field and to each other. An often used buzzword for this idea is called **STEM-education**.
This project is also applicable in this context.

This resulted in a project where a combination of virtual reality, physical objects and abstraction is used.
This should allow the students to get a better idea of what it will be like in the work-field, as soon as they start
their education.

In order to link physical objects to a virtual environment, a way of (accurately) locating those objects is needed.
For this purpose we opted for a **computer vision** system. This is both versatile and easy to implement. It is also
accurate enough for small setups, so that the whole system can still fit on the average bench in a classroom.

For our thesis we mostly focussed on the vision part of the system.

## What does it do?
At this point the basic framework for the computer vision has been implemented. As an example, we used a
**line-follower**. The computer vision is used to follow the line-follower and time the laps.

This is just a proof of concept and should illustrate the capabilities of the system. It should also show how to
location of various objects can be extracted from the frames and be used to trigger various actions.
We hope to further expand the system, but would love to see other ideas and implementations using this system
(or concept).

The original thesis is written in Dutch, but will hopefully be translated into english for a broader audience.
