                <h1 class="section-title">What is a PID?</h1>
                <p>A PID-controller is the most popular and most used <em>closed-loop controller</em>.</p>
                <figure class="center-aligned"><img alt="PID-controller schematic" src="assets/img/thesis/PID.bmp">
                    <figcaption><a href="#">PID-controller schematic</a><br>&copy; 2019</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    A PID-controller receives an input, this will be the desired value (or state) of the
                    system. Often this is called the <em>set-point</em>, in formulas <em>sp</em> is used. The
                    current state (or process-value) is denoted as <em>pv</em>. Often this is a value coming
                    from a sensor, and needs to be converted in order to work with the PID-controller. Here
                    it will be assumed, for simplicity, that the process-value is already correctly formatted
                    by the process itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A PID-controller is based around three parallel calculations:
                    the <b>P</b>roportional, the <b>I</b>ntegral and the <b>D</b>erivative.
                    Each calculation has its own weight in the final result. These weights are called
                    K-factors. The PID-controller can be tuned and modified by calibrating these K-factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The PID-controller is time-dependant, as a result all functions and expressions are a
                    function of time. The PID-controller is closed-loop controller since the output is fed
                    (indirectly) back to the input.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1 class="section-title">Input</h1>
                <h1 class="section-subtitle">Set-point</h1>
                <p>
                    The set-point, as mentioned, is the desired state of the system. The controller will do
                    everything it can to get the system to that state.<br>In most cases the set-point is static; it is
                    set once (during calibration) and never
                    changed.
                </p>
                <h1 class="section-subtitle">Error</h1>
                <p>
                    The input to the actual PID-algorithm is called the error. This is a result from
                    subtracting the process-value from the set-point.
                </p>
                <div class="formula-container">
                    <div class="formula">
                        <p>$$e(t) = sp(t) - pv(t)$$</p>
                        <p class="caption">Formula for the error</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The PID-controller will do everything to get the system to the desired state, this is
                    achieved when the error becomes zero. Or when the process-value becomes equal to the setpoint.
                </p>

                <h1 class="section-title">Proportional - P</h1>
                <p>
                    The first of the PID calculations is the easiest one. The result from this calculation is
                    proportional to the error, as the name would imply. The K<sub>p</sub>-factor will
                    determine how proportional the result is to the error. With a larger K<sub>p</sub>-factor
                    the result will rise quicker with a rising error, while a smaller K<sub>p</sub>-factor
                    will result in a slower rising result.
                </p>
                <div class="formula-container">
                    <div class="formula">
                        <p>$$P = K_{p} \cdot e(t)$$</p>

                    The P-term is a really simple but effective term. For slow changing processes, a P only
                    controller is sufficient. The P-term, however, "looks" only at the current error, because
                    of this <em>overshoot</em> will appear quickly. This overshoot will also lead to an
                    oscillating controller. The state of the system will bounce around the desired state.
                    The D-term offers a solution to this issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The P-term will not act on small errors, as the result will be to small to have an impact.
                    In order to resolve long-standing small errors the I-term is needed.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1 class="section-title">Integral - I</h1>
                <p>
                    The I-term will integrate the error over time. With a constant (small) error the output of
                    this term will continue to grow, eventually leading to a response that is strong enough to
                    to work away that the cause of that error.
                    The I-term "looks" into the past, as it were.
                </p>
                <div class="formula-container">
                    <div class="formula">
                        <p>$$I = K_{i} \int_0^t e(t)dt$$</p>
                        <p class="caption">Formula for a I-controller</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The I-term is used most in system where the state changes slowly. When the state changes
                    rapidly, the error won't be present long enough to make the output of the I-term rise
                    significantly. As a result it won't ever have enough weight in the final result to matter.
                    In a fast changing system it is best to leave out the I-term. This will save in
                    calculation time and resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the nature in which integrals work, it is important that the I-term is limited at
                    all times. If an error persists the output of the I-term will keep on rising. In theory
                    the output will rise to infinity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In practice the I-term is often limited from the start. In the case of an analog
                    implementation, the output value can never rise above the supply voltage.<br>In a digital
                    implementation, the output will be held in a certain variable type. If the
                    output keeps rising, a certain point there will be an overflow, and the variable will roll
                    around to the smallest value it can hold (or vice-versa).<br>There are limitations already in place.
                    But in the case of the digital implementation this
                    limit would have disastrous consequences. Because of the value wrapping around, the
                    controller would start steering in the opposite direction, making the error even large.
                    This would create an enormously unstable system, that could run-away at any moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In practice there will always be limitations. However by implementing our own limits, we
                    can control when they get hit and how they get hit. This will result in expected behaviour
                    that can be controlled.

                <h1 class="section-title">Derivative - D</h1>
                <p>
                    The D-term will take the derivative of the error, it looks at how quickly the error is
                    changing. It will "see" into the future as it were. It forms a way of predicting of how
                    large the error is going to become.
                </p>
                <div class="formula-container">
                    <div class="formula">
                        <p>$$D = K_{d} \frac{de(t)}{dt}$$</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The D-term will shorten the reaction-time of the PID-controller and result in overall
                    faster controller. The way a derivative works makes the D-term especially susceptible to
                    noise. This makes that the D-term can give quite a large output, even if the system is at
                    the desired state. In order to prevent this, the time-step can be increased. To keep the
                    other two terms fast enough, the input to the D-term can be averaged out. This will reduce
                    the noise on the signal.

                <h1 class="section-title">Output</h1>
                <p>
                    The output of the PID-controller is obtained by adding all three terms together.
                    The three terms can be substituted by their respected equations.
