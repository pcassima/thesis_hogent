                            | This project is a proof-of-concept to use a computer-vision system as a way of accurately
                            | positioning objects, so that they can be transferred over to a virtual environment.
                            br
                            | We worked out an example to showcase that a simple and cheap webcam can be used to accurately
                            | and repeatedly locate objects on a surface area of an A0 sized piece of paper. This is a size
                            | we found to still fit on most classroom tables. This makes it perfect for use in
                            | the classroom.
                        p
                            | This virtual environment (i.e. virtual reality) is a project started by our teacher and
                            | promoter, to improve the quality of the education. More specifically the practical side
                            | of the education.
                            br
                            | This virtual reality would allow the students to program and interact with actual, industrial,
                            | machines and installations, without the usual risks and costs.
                            br
                            | If one of the students were to make a terrible mistake, and program the machine in such a way
                            | that would destroy it. Everything would be fixed by simply restarting the simulation.
                        p
                            | Currently the students learn how to program industrial machines by programming the controllers
                            | used in those machines. But all in- and outputs are substituted by switches and LEDs.
                            | In our opinion this doesn't give an accurate feeling of what an actual machines acts like.
                            br
                            | Also since the switches have to be operated manually according to the desired situation,
                            | certain scenario's can't be simulated this way. As a consequence the students miss out on
                            | an important part of their education.
                        p
                            | However by virtual reality alone they would also miss a big part of their education. As they
                            | would no longer get any physical feedback on their work. Everything would just be pixels on
                            | a computer screen.
                            br
                            | As such we believe that the students still needs something physical, that they can touch and
                            | interact with. Something that they can see moving in front of them.
                        p
                            | A combination of both virtualisation and something along the lines of a scale model would be
                            | the perfect solution.
                            br
                            | But there needs to be a link between the physical world and the virtual reality. This is
                            | where the computer-vision system comes into play.
                        p
                            | After comparing and evaluating the many different techniques there are for position, we came
                            | to the conclusion that none of them are suitable for this application.
                            br
                            | Some of them are far too inaccurate (such as GPS), while others are expensive and out of
                            | budget for most schools (such as RF).

                            | context. It also shows how machine vision can be used for automation.
                            | By using the MQTT standard the system can easily be controlled by external sources, as well
                            | send control signals to other systems. This allows the project to be easily integrated.
