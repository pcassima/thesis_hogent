                        | This project is a proof-of-concept to use a computer-vision system as a way of accurately
                        | positioning objects, so that they can be transferred over to a virtual environment.
                        br
                        | We worked out an example to showcase that a simple and cheap webcam can be used to accurately
                        | and repeatedly locate objects on a surface area of an A0 sized piece of paper. This is a size
                        | we found to still fit on most classroom tables. This makes it perfect for use in
                        | the classroom.

                        | This virtual environment (i.e. virtual reality) is a project started by our teacher and
                        | promoter, to improve the quality of the education. More specifically the practical side
                        | of the education.
                        br
                        | This virtual reality would allow the students to program and interact with actual, industrial,
                        | machines and installations, without the usual risks and costs.
                        br
                        | If one of the students were to make a terrible mistake, and program the machine in such a way
                        | that would destroy it. Everything would be fixed by simply restarting the simulation.
                    p
                        | Currently the students learn how to program industrial machines by programming the controllers
                        | used in those machines. But all in- and outputs are substituted by switches and LEDs.
                        | In our opinion this doesn't give an accurate feeling of what an actual machines acts like.
                        br
                        | Also since the switches have to be operated manually according to the desired situation,
                        | certain scenario's can't be simulated this way. As a consequence the students miss out on
                        | an important part of their education.
                    p
                        | However by virtual reality alone they would also miss a big part of their education. As they
                        | would no longer get any physical feedback on their work. Everything would just be pixels on
                        | a computer screen.
                        br
                        | As such we believe that the students still needs something physical, that they can touch and
                        | interact with. Something that they can see moving in front of them.
                    p
                        | A combination of both virtualisation and something along the lines of a scale model would be
                        | the perfect solution.
                        br
                        | But there needs to be a link between the physical world and the virtual reality. This is
                        | where the computer-vision system comes into play.
                    p
                        | After comparing and evaluating the many different techniques there are for position, we came
                        | to the conclusion that none of them are suitable for this application.
                        br
                        | Some of them are far too inaccurate (such as GPS), while others are expensive and out of
                        | budget for most schools (such as RF).

                        | context. It also shows how machine vision can be used for automation.

                        | send control signals to other systems. This allows the project to be easily integrated.
