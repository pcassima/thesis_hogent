          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This project is a proof-of-concept to use a computer-vision system as a way of accurately
            positioning objects, so that they can be transferred over to a virtual environment.<br>We worked out an example to showcase that a simple and cheap webcam can be used to accurately
            and repeatedly locate objects on a surface area of an A0 sized piece of paper. This is a size
            we found to still fit on most classroom tables. This makes it perfect for use in
            the classroom.
          </p>
          <figure class="generic_photo"><img src="assets/img/concepts/minicar_concept_3.png">
            <figcaption>Rear view of the concept</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            This virtual environment (i.e. virtual reality) is a project started by our teacher and
            promoter, to improve the quality of the education. More specifically the practical side
            of the education.<br>This virtual reality would allow the students to program and interact with actual, industrial,
            machines and installations, without the usual risks and costs.<br>If one of the students were to make a terrible mistake, and program the machine in such a way
            that would destroy it. Everything would be fixed by simply restarting the simulation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently the students learn how to program industrial machines by programming the controllers
            used in those machines. But all in- and outputs are substituted by switches and LEDs.
            In our opinion this doesn't give an accurate feeling of what an actual machines acts like.<br>Also since the switches have to be operated manually according to the desired situation,
            certain scenario's can't be simulated this way. As a consequence the students miss out on
            an important part of their education.
          </p>
          <p>
            However by virtual reality alone they would also miss a big part of their education. As they
            would no longer get any physical feedback on their work. Everything would just be pixels on
            a computer screen.<br>As such we believe that the students still needs something physical, that they can touch and
            interact with. Something that they can see moving in front of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            A combination of both virtualisation and something along the lines of a scale model would be
            the perfect solution.<br>But there needs to be a link between the physical world and the virtual reality. This is
            where the computer-vision system comes into play.
          </p>
          <p>
            After comparing and evaluating the many different techniques there are for position, we came
            to the conclusion that none of them are suitable for this application.<br>Some of them are far too inaccurate (such as GPS), while others are expensive and out of
            budget for most schools (such as RF).
          </p>

          <h2>goal</h2>
          <figure class="generic_photo right_aligned"><img src="assets/img/concepts/mainboard_concept_1.png">
            <figcaption>The concept for the mainboard for the car</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The goal of this project as mentioned before is to show that a (lightweight)
            computer vision can be used to locate physical objects to transfer them over to virtual
            reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using cheap and easy to find materials this project will be easy to implement in all parts
            of education, so that everyone can enjoy the benefits of better education.
            By releasing the code as open-source, there is no additional cost for software licenses.
            This also ensures that everyone has access to the latest version.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project is aimed at improving education at every stage. It should be a fun and
            lightweight project to introduce children to technology, programming and engineering.
            While at the same time increasing the quality of the practical side of higher education.
            Giving students a better feeling of the work field.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project also teaches about computer-vision and how it can be used in an industrial
            context. It also shows how machine vision can be used for automation.
            By using the MQTT standard the system can easily be controlled by external sources, as well
            send control signals to other systems. This allows the project to be easily integrated.
